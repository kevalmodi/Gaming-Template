		       			Watch Dogs 2 features a new protagonist; Marcus Holloway. All hacks from the previous game have returned, along with new, more in-depth hacks called "contextual hacks." When the player activates the NetHack View, instead of the previous on screen display window, the entire screen morphs into a hacking view outlining civilians, automobiles, and any hacking opportunities.<br><br>

In Watch Dogs 2, you are now part of DedSec, and the game introduces a co-op system in which the player can complete side missions and explore the world with another player. New vehicles have been introduced, such as scooters and ATVs. The player has an RC Jumper and a Quadcopter which they can deploy anytime, through which they can hack objects mentioned above. The parkour has changed drastically so that the player can climb faster and move around the environment more fluidly.<br><br>

The multiplayer mode has also been revamped. In addition to the new co-op gameplay and the classic hacker invasion mode, new PvP (player-vs-player) elements have been introduced in the form of "Bounty Hunter" mode. In Bounty Hunter, if a player causes too much chaos in-game or forges evidence against themselves, up to three other players at a time can be inserted into the target's game and simultaneously attack said player, along with the assistance of the local police force. Bounty Hunter is also made more dynamic in that it is also possible for two players in co-op to be attacked by two other players if one of them has a bounty on them.<br><br>

The police A.I. has undergone a major overhaul from its heavily criticized predecessor, the Chicago Police Department. The police can now arrest NPC's who commit crimes, even if Marcus frames them with fake evidence and have them arrested in result. The police will also break up any street fights and respond with lethal force to criminals who are actively shooting at the player or themselves. They can also be seen on patrol more often in the streets, increasing the chances of assisting Marcus clear out an area full of thugs, provided that he himself does not get involved.<br><br>

Another addition is the implementation of conflict. Two or more factions, or gangs, in conflict can engage in large gunfights or even chaos to the area of the conflict, providing a challenge and distraction for the player. The player will be alerted in the top-right hand corner of the screen when factions engage in combat.<br><br>
